# Sleep Based Sequencer

Tuning did not work on CPU core 3, so we isolated the core by updating 
`/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` on our rasppi to include `isolcpus=1-3`, and
then rebooted our rasppi.

We also set the following parameters:
`isolcpus=2-3 nohz_full=2-3 rcu_nocbs=2-3 kthread_cpus=0-1 nosoftlockup rcu_nocb_poll`

Each of these parameters explained:
1. `rcu_nocb_poll`: 
2. `nosoftlockup`: prevents the kernel from doing 120 second soft lockup

Another thing we can set is the performance governor to `performance`:

You can also write to `/proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us` to set the runtime maximum for the real-time scheduler.
```sh
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us
```
